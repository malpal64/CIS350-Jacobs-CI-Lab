if a == True:
    print("This was true")

And you need to follow that indentation as you go.gitp

Ok, let's add some code.  In math_functions.py add the following:

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract_numbers(a, b):
    return a - b

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Adding:", add_numbers(2,4))
    print("Subtracting:", subtract_numbers(9,2))
